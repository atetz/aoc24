# Advent Of Code 2024
My Advent of Code attempts for 2024.
This year I'm going to switch back to Python. My goals:
- Get at least 20 stars to beat last year's personal best of 19 stars
- Try out [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for the first time
- Work on good test coverage with pytest
- Produce pythonic code
- No AI assistant in IDE.
