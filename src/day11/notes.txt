Puzzle takeaways

- Do not try to outsmart the puzzle when it says the order of the stones are preserved :)
    - Trying to think of algorithm that predicts the stones based on test input did not result in right anwer because every stone leads a individual path.
- looked for help on part two, hinted on caching, tried to implement my own as challenge.
    - add every result of func to cache.
